## Schematic representation of the genome organization and functional domains of S protein for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 

[![SARS-CoV_MERS-CoV](/images/SARS-CoV_MERS-CoV_genome_organization_and_S-protein_domains.png)](https://www.mdpi.com/books/pdfview/book/1893)

The single-stranded RNA genomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV encode two large genes, the ORF1a and ORF1b genes, which encode 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1â€“nsp16) that are highly conserved throughout coronaviruses. The structural genes encode the structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), which are common features to all coronaviruses. The accessory genes (shades of green) are unique to different coronaviruses in terms of number, genomic organization, sequence, and function. The structure of each S protein is shown beneath the genome organization. The S protein mainly contains the S1 and S2 subunits. The residue numbers in each region represent their positions in the S protein of SARS and MERS, respectively. The S1/S2 cleavage sites are highlighted by dotted lines. SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; CP, cytoplasm domain; FP, fusion peptide; HR, heptad repeat; RBD, receptor-binding domain; RBM, receptor-binding motif; SP, signal peptide; TM, transmembrane domain.
